<span class="comment">It is a property of countable sets that they can be enumerated in a list, so in order to show that the set of languages is uncountable by contradiction, it is sufficient to assume the set is countable to make a list and then construct a language that differs from every element of that list.</span>

In order to obtain a contradiction, assume that the set of languages over a finite alphabet is countable. Since the [set of strings over a finite alphabet is countable]({% post_url 2015-12-30-0010-Countability1 %}), construct a table using the list of languages as the rows and the list of strings as the columns, and fill in each cell \\( (i, j) \\) with a \\( 1 \\) if \\( s_j \\) is a member of \\( L_i \\), and \\( 0 \\) otherwise. 

<span class="comment">The rows of the table illustrate which strings are members of each language using an [indicator function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_function). The cells in the table below are filled in with completely arbitrary values to illustrate the proof. Any unique entries for each row would work just as well.</span>

$$
\begin{array}{c|lcr}
{} & s_1 & s_2 & s_3 & s_4 & ... \\ \hline
L_1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & ... \\
L_2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & ... \\
L_3 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & ... \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
L_i & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & ... \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots \\
\end{array}
$$

<span class="comment">By definition, a language is a set of strings, so two languages are the same if they represent the same set (i.e., if they contain all of the same strings), and there is at least one string they do not share as an element. Therefore, it would be a contradiction if a language exists that differs from the language in each row of the table.</span>

Define a language \\( L_D = \\{ s_i : s_i \notin L_i \\} \\)<span class="comment"> /* i.e., the \\( i^{th} \\) string is in \\( L_D \\) if it is not in \\( L_i \\) (the language on row \\(i\\))*/</span>. For the table above, \\( L_D = \\{ 0, 1, 1, ... \\} \\) (i.e., the opposite of the values on the top-left to bottom-right diagonal). Starting from the first row of the table, observe that \\( L_D \\) is not the same as the language \\( L_1 \\) because \\( s_1 \in L_1 \\) but \\( s_1 \notin L_D \\); \\( s_2 \notin L_1 \\) but \\( s_2 \in L_D \\); and so on.

In general, by the definition of \\( L_D \\), if \\( s_i \in L_i \\) then \\( s_i \notin L_D \\), and if \\( s_i \notin L_i \\) then \\( s_i \in L_D \\). Since \\( L_D \\) differs from every row \\( L_i \\) by at least one string on the diagonal, \\( L_D \\) cannot be one of the rows of the table, which is a contradiction. 

<span class="comment">This technique is known as [Cantor's Diagonal Argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument). One of the essential elements of a diagonal argument is defining a set that differs from every other element by construction (usually) from the negation of a member of each of the other sets with which it is compared, as was done with \\( L_D \\) in this example.</span>

According to the assumption that the set of languages is countable, the rows of the table should contain every possible language, but \\( L_D \\) is not included in the rows of the table. This is a contradiction, so the assumption that the set of languages is countable must be wrong, and the set of languages must instead be uncountable.

QED

<span class="comment">One confusing aspect of this proof arises from a subtle difference between strings and languages. All strings are finite by definition, while languages can contain an infinite number of strings. It is this distinction that results in the difference between the set of strings being countable and the set of languages being uncountable.</span>
