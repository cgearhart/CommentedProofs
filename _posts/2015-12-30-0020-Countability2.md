**Pf:**

This proof generalizes the argument from the proof of the [countability of strings]({% post_url 2015-12-30-0010-Countability1 %}) to the general case of finite sets.

<span class="comment">/* Start by stating the definitions of the terms in the claim to identify what would be a sufficient argument for the proof.*/</span>

<span class="comment">/* This definition means that \\( \Sigma^* \\) is the set of all strings that can be made by concatenating any combination of letters from the alphabet \\( \Sigma \\), which is equivalent to the union of all strings of each length \\( (k=1, 2, ... ) \\). Note that we can write $$\Sigma^*$$ as a union this way because every string is finite (by definition), so this union contains all possible strings.*/</span>

For an alphabet with k characters, there are $$k^n$$ words of length $$n$$. <span class="comment">/* This can be easily verified by writing down the strings of length $$n$$ for a particular alphabet, or in the general case by recognizing that each character in a string can take on one of $$k$$ values, so for $$n$$ characters there must be $$k^n$$ possible strings.*/</span> Without the loss of generality, consider the alphabet \\( \Sigma= \\{ 0,1 \\} \\) (any other finite alphabet with more letters will simply have a larger $$k$$), and define a one-to-one correspondence between the elements in each subset of strings and the next \\( 2^n \\) natural numbers.

\\( \\{ 1 \\} \rightarrow \\{ \varepsilon \\} \\)  <span class="comment">/* Note: \\( \varepsilon \\) is the empty string./*</span><br>
\\( \\{ 2,3 \\} \rightarrow \\{ "0", "1" \\} \\)<br>
\\( \\{ 4,5,6,7 \\} \rightarrow \\{ "00", "01", "10", "11" \\} \\)<br>
\\( ... \\)<br>
\\( \\{ N_{n-1}+1, N_n \\} \rightarrow \\{ "000...0", ..., "111...1" \\} \\)

The order within each subset of strings doesn't matter as long as there is only one natural number for each substring, so choosing lexicographical order is sufficient to complete the correspondence. <span class="comment">/* [Lexicographically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order) basically means alphabetical order.*/</span>

QED <span class="comment">/* The proof is complete because we have shown an example of a one-to-one correspondence between strings over a finite alphabet and the natural numbers.*/</span>
