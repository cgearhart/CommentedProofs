{"name":"CommentedProofs","tagline":"Long form, extensively commented proofs from the Georgia Tech OMS CS-6505 lectures","body":"### Commented Proofs\r\nMany OMS students who are not used to the formal mathematical study of computer science at the level of rigor required for the Computability, Complexity, & Algorithms course (CS-6505) have struggled to understand the proofs presented in lecture or writing such proofs on their own. The lectures are presented based on the assumption that every student has taken (and remembers) an undergrad curriculum including discrete mathematics & algorithms, but pre-reqs are not enforced on enrollment in graduate courses at Georgia Tech, and many students in the OMS haven't looked at those subjects in a decade or more. Commented Proofs tries to reduce the expectation of prior knowledge about the subject by presenting the proofs for each theorem from lecture with additional details and context (like comments in source code) at a level appropriate for students who are either new or returning to the formal mathematical study of CS.\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nChris Gearhart (@cgearhart) is an OMS student.","google":"UA-71820250-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
